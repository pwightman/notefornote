/*
    When you send the “play” message to a regular sound
    (instance of Sound.m), the sound rewinds and plays from
    the start. This is not always desirable, a lot of times
    you would like to play many instances of the same sound
    simultaneously (think machinegun). This is what this
    class is for.
