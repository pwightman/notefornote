This app is my very first attempt at an App Store-worthy iOS app. One of those code bases you look back on and laugh
at your naivete. It was far too ambitious, and was a total flop, but I loved it dearly and used it often so no regrets.
If I ever have time or need, I'd like to come back and revisit it. Potential employers, I [suggest](https://tinkerlearn.com)

### Description

Note for Note allows you to translate notes between instruments, such as piano -> guitar, piano -> bass, etc. This is
useful when teaching lessons or otherwise trying to communicate musical concepts more easily explained on another
instrument. Bass guitar, 6-string guitar, and piano are supported. Stringed instruments allow you to restrict the
range in which matching notes show up, and a "show all notes" feature can be used to show chords within the range.

### Known issues

The biggest known issue is that it doesn't work on iOS 7. There's something screwy with the rotation logic that
causes it to render in portrait instead of landscape, so everything is stretched weird. That'd be the first thing
to fix and I imagine it wouldn't be too terribly hard to track down.

### Contributing

I don't actively work on this project at the moment. If you're interested in helping in some way, let me know.
Contributing would happen via normal pull requests after forking.
